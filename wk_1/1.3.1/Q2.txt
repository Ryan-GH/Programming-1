I would test the program in Q1 by making a table of cases where I could expect the program
to do certain tasks. The table would have the following columns: input, expected outcome,
actual outcome. If the expected outcome didn't match the actual outcome at any stage, I
would begin to troubleshoot the issue and fix the code before running each of the test
cases again.
